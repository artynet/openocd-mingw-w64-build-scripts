These are the configuration files missing in some of the official packages.

* __hidapi-0.7.0-*.pc__ - configuration files for libhid;
* __libusb-win32-1.2.6.0.pc__ - configuration file for libusb-w32.

These files are copied to the internal install folder and will be used by pkg-config to configure the compiler and linker settings.
